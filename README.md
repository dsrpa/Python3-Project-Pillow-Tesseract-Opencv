Final Project Python 3 Course

This project introduces to third-party APIs and shows how to manipulate images using the Python imaging library (pillow), how to apply optical character recognition to images to recognize text (tesseract and py-tesseract), and how to identify faces in images using the popular opencv library. 

This is part of fifth and final course in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.

Outcomes:
How to inspect and understand APIs and third party libraries to be used with Python 3

How to apply the Python imaging library (pillow) to open, view, and manipulate images, including cropping, resizing, recoloring, and overlaying text

How to apply the python tesseract (py-tesseract) library with Python 3 in order to detect text in images through optical character recognition (OCR)

How to apply the open source computer vision library (opencv) to detect faces in images, & how to crop and manipulate these faces into contact sheets
